# Tool Tracker

Cynthia runs several car repair shops.
Since they repair all kinds of cars, they have a LOT of tools.
One of the best ways Cynthia has found to save money at her shops is to keep a close eye on tool fatigue, as well as their warranties.
Often times a toolâ€™s warranty runs out just before it breaks, and if they had used the warranty before it expired, they could have gotten a new tool for free.
Cynthia would like a simple program to keep track of those warranties:
1. The ability to enter a tool name, quantity, and the expiry date of the warranty, as well as some notes.
2. The ability to enter the estimated time until the tool will fail
3. The ability to dump a report on which tools are closest to failing, or having their warranty expires.
